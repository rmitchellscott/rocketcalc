<!-- <p> Because a stomp rocketâ€™s energy is added instantaneously when the rocket is launched, its trajectory is purely ballistic. <br>It goes straight up until it stops for just a moment, then falls back down. It takes an equal time going up and coming down, so we can divide the total time of flight in half to determine when the rocket was at its highest point. <br>From there, we know how fast gravity pulls on an object (32 additional feet per second every second) and can calculate how high up the rocket must have fallen from in the second half of its journey through the sky. </p>
<p>The equation is: &frac12;<var>g</var><var>t</var><sup>2</sup></p>
<p>The <var>g</var> is for the acceleration of gravity, the <var>t</var> is for time (in our case, we'll divide total time by 2 to get <var>t</var>).</p> -->
